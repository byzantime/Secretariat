Use this tool to create and manage a structured task list for your current session. This helps you track progress, organize complex tasks, and demonstrate thoroughness to the user.
It also helps the user understand the progress of the task and overall progress of their requests.

## When to Use This Tool
Use this tool proactively in these scenarios:

1. Complex multi-step tasks - When a task requires 3 or more distinct steps or actions
2. Non-trivial and complex tasks - Tasks that require careful planning or multiple operations
3. User explicitly requests todo list - When the user directly asks you to use the todo list
4. User provides multiple tasks - When users provide a list of things to be done (numbered or comma-separated)
5. After receiving new instructions - Immediately capture user requirements as todos. Feel free to edit the todo list based on new information.
6. After completing a task - Mark it complete and add any new follow-up tasks
7. When you start working on a new task, mark the todo as in_progress. Ideally you should only have one todo as in_progress at a time. Complete existing tasks before starting new ones.

## When NOT to Use This Tool

Skip using this tool when:
1. There is only a single, straightforward task
2. The task is trivial and tracking it provides no organizational benefit
3. The task can be completed in less than 3 trivial steps
4. The task is purely conversational or informational

NOTE that you should not use this tool if there is only one trivial task to do. In this case you are better off just doing the task directly.

## Examples of When to Use the Todo List

<example>
User: I need help organizing my daily schedule, creating a budget plan, and researching vacation destinations for next summer.
Assistant: I'll help you with these tasks. Let me create a todo list to track this work.
*Creates todo list with the following items:*
1. Help organize daily schedule - gather current commitments and preferences
2. Create comprehensive budget plan - assess income, expenses, and financial goals
3. Research vacation destinations for next summer - compile options with costs and activities
*Begins working on the first task*

<reasoning>
The assistant used the todo list because:
1. The user provided multiple distinct tasks that require different approaches
2. Each task is complex and involves multiple steps (gathering info, analysis, compilation)
3. The todo list helps ensure all three requests are addressed systematically
4. This approach allows tracking progress across all three areas
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: Can you help me write a professional email to my manager about a project delay, and also help me brainstorm solutions to get back on track?
Assistant: I'll help you write a professional email about the project delay and brainstorm solutions. Let me create a todo list to track this work.
*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Draft professional email to manager explaining project delay, 2) Brainstorm practical solutions to get project back on track, 3) Review and refine both the email and solutions*

<reasoning>
The assistant used the todo list because:
1. This involves two related but distinct deliverables (email + solutions)
2. Each requires different approaches and considerations
3. The tasks are interconnected and benefit from systematic tracking
4. This ensures both parts of the request are fully addressed
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: I'm planning a dinner party for 8 people next weekend. Can you help me plan the menu, create a shopping list, and suggest a timeline for preparation?
Assistant: I'd be happy to help you plan your dinner party! Let me create a todo list to organize this planning.
*Creates todo list with items like: 1) Plan dinner party menu for 8 people considering dietary restrictions, 2) Create comprehensive shopping list organized by store sections, 3) Develop preparation timeline with tasks scheduled optimally*

<reasoning>
The assistant used the todo list because:
1. Planning a dinner party involves multiple complex, interconnected tasks
2. Menu planning, shopping, and timing all require different considerations
3. The systematic approach ensures nothing is forgotten
4. Each task builds on the others and benefits from organized tracking
</reasoning>
</example>

## Examples of When NOT to Use the Todo List

<example>
User: What's the weather like today?
Assistant: I don't have access to real-time weather data, but you can check the current weather by looking at a weather app, website like weather.com, or asking a voice assistant like Siri or Google Assistant.

<reasoning>
The assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, straightforward informational request that can be answered immediately without multiple steps or complex planning.
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: Can you explain what a metaphor is?
Assistant: A metaphor is a figure of speech that directly compares two unlike things by stating that one thing is another, without using "like" or "as." For example, "Time is money" compares time to money, suggesting both are valuable resources that can be spent or saved.

<reasoning>
The assistant did not use the todo list because this is a simple informational request requiring a single explanation, not multiple tasks or complex operations.
</reasoning>
</example>

<example>
User: Please remind me to call my dentist.
Assistant: I'm not able to set actual reminders or send notifications, but I'd suggest setting a reminder on your phone, calendar app, or writing it down so you don't forget to call your dentist.

<reasoning>
The assistant did not use the todo list because this is a single, simple request that can be addressed with one response. There's no complex task to track or multiple steps to manage.
</reasoning>
</example>

## Task States and Management

1. **Task States**: Use these states to track progress:
   - pending: Task not yet started
   - in_progress: Currently working on (limit to ONE task at a time)
   - completed: Task finished successfully
   - cancelled: Task no longer needed

2. **Task Management**:
   - Update task status in real-time as you work
   - Mark tasks complete IMMEDIATELY after finishing (don't batch completions)
   - Only have ONE task in_progress at any time
   - Complete current tasks before starting new ones
   - Cancel tasks that become irrelevant

3. **Task Breakdown**:
   - Create specific, actionable items
   - Break complex tasks into smaller, manageable steps
   - Use clear, descriptive task names

When in doubt, use this tool. Being proactive with task management demonstrates attentiveness and ensures you complete all requirements successfully.
