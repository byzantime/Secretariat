        This tool searches across all previous conversations (excluding the current one)
        to find relevant memories that match the semantic meaning of your query. This is
        useful for:

        **When to use this tool:**
        - Finding information discussed in previous conversations
        - Locating past decisions or agreements made with the user
        - Searching for specific topics or concepts mentioned before
        - Retrieving context from earlier interactions
        - Looking up previous explanations or solutions provided

        **Examples of good queries:**
        - "project deadlines mentioned last week"
        - "user's preferences for communication style"
        - "previous discussions about budget constraints"
        - "technical solutions we explored for database issues"
        - "meeting notes from client presentations"

        Args:
            query: The search query to find relevant memories. Use descriptive
                   phrases that capture the semantic meaning of what you're looking for.

        Returns:
            A markdown-formatted list of relevant memories with timestamps, roles,
            and utterances, or a message if no memories are found.
