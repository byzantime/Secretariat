    """Use this tool to search through past conversation memories using semantic search.

    This tool searches across all previous conversations (excluding the current one)
    to find relevant memories that match the semantic meaning of your query. This is
    useful for:

    **When to use this tool:**
    - Finding information discussed in previous conversations
    - Locating past decisions or agreements made with the user
    - Searching for specific topics or concepts mentioned before
    - Retrieving context from earlier interactions
    - Looking up previous explanations or solutions provided

    **Examples of good queries:**
    - "project deadlines mentioned last week"
    - "user's preferences for communication style"
    - "previous discussions about budget constraints"
    - "technical solutions we explored for database issues"
    - "meeting notes from client presentations"

    Args:
        query: The search query to find relevant memories. Use descriptive
               phrases that capture the semantic meaning of what you're looking for.

    Returns:
        A markdown-formatted list of relevant memories with timestamps, roles,
        and utterances, or a message if no memories are found.
